# instagram_clone

A new Flutter project.

Instagram_clone is a social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos with their followers. It was created as a mobile application but is also accessible through a web browser. The app provides a feed where users can see posts from the accounts they follow, and they can like, comment, and share posts with their own followers.<br/>
